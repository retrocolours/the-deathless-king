      Greetings, wanderer. By some strange twist of fate, you have found your
      way into this forsaken realmâ€”a game woven from the dark threads of Eastern
      European lore and myth. I am the all-seeing presence that presides over
      this place, and I bid you to sit by the flickering firelight. Here, you
      shall walk in the footsteps of heroes from ancient tales, though be
      warned: each choice you make shall carve your fate, and every step shall
      be fraught with peril and mystery. Your destiny lies before you. Dare you
      proceed?
